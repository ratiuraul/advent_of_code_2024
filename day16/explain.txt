# simmilar to Dijkstra
# whenever we move, we choose the lowest cost path
# list of unvisited nodes
# starting from root, mark as visited
# examine cost of each path, pick shortest one
# mark the next node as visited
# update costs of nodes from new node
# we reached all nodes, return to root and check the other option
# when all nodes are visited, we are done
